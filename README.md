This is the provided git repository for the WACC compilers lab. You should work
in this repository regularly committing and pushing your work back to GitLab.

# Provided files/directories

## src/main

The src/main directory is where you code for your compiler should go, and just
contains a stub hello world file with a simple calculator inside.

## src/test
The src/test directory is where you should put the code for your tests, which
can be ran via `scala-cli test .`. The suggested framework is `scalatest`, the dependency
for which has already been included.

## project.scala
The `project.scala` is the definition of your project's build requirements. By default,
this skeleton has added the latest stable versions of both `scalatest` and `parsley`
to the build: you should check **regularly** to see if your `parsley` needs updating
during the course of WACC!

## compile

The compile script can be edited to change the frontend interface to your WACC
compiler. You are free to change the language used in this script, but do not
change its name.

## Makefile

Your Makefile should be edited so that running 'make' in the root directory
builds your WACC compiler. Currently running 'make' will call
`scala-cli --power package . --server=false --jvm system --force`, producing a file called
`wacc-compiler`
in the root directory of the project.
